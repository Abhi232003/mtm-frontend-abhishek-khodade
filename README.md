# mtm-frontend-abhishek-khodade

An “Itinerary Planner” for My Trip Mates.
Created using React + Vite.
Also implemented an interactive 3D model of Earth using THREE.js or React Three Fiber.

Users can add, view, update, and delete travel tasks, demonstrating familiarity with CRUD operations in React using
Hooks.

Key Functionalities:-
• Add Tasks: Users can enter tasks into an input field and add them to their itinerary.
• View Tasks: Display all the tasks in a list.
• Update Tasks: Users can edit the text of tasks in their list.
• Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from their list.

To run the application on your local machine, 
-Clone the respository at your machine.
-Navigate to \itinerary-planner in terminal.
-Run command 'npm i' to install all the required dependecies.
-run command 'npm run dev' to run the project in your browser.

This project has been deployed and is live using Vercel.
URl:- [https://mtm-frontend-abhishek-khodade.vercel.app/](https://mtm-frontend-abhishek-khodade.vercel.app/).
Important:- The functionality to persist itinerary list won't work on live website as it won't be able to use localStoage saved data as it would if ran locally,
so refreshing list page would throw error '404: NOT_FOUND'.

Note - This project doesn't include media queriy, so it wont work properly in smaller viewports.
